## Principles & Concepts

A document under active retention can not be modified or deleted. 

### Rules definition


Each rule is composed of :

 - id
 - a condition for retention start / cutoff
       - event
       - duration       
 - a cutoff action: *what we do after entering cutoff*
       - Automation 
 - a condition for retention end
      - event
      - duration   
 - a retention end action : *what we do after entering cutoff*
      - automation 
 - the retention duration ( a Java period)
 - a begin delay 
 - retention-reminder-days: 
  


### Record facet

When a retention rule is applied on the document we store the data into the  Record facet that is added to each document under Retention.
The facet holds:


   - associated rule(s)
   - retention start (target or actual): min_cutoff_at
   - retention end  (target or actual) : max_retention_at ( composed from all rules if more than one rules are applied to this document)
   - status flag  ('unmanaged', 'active', 'expired')



## How it works

### Defining Rule 

There are two ways to contribute retention rules:
- statically, by contributing to the "rules" extension point in the RetentionService
- dynamically via the facet 'RetentionRule': in this case, the id of the rule is the id of the document where the facet is added ( using as a base storage for the rule)

### Static configuration

These are the steps to contribute with new rules as a extension point:
- Access to Nuxeo Studio
- Browse to *CONFIGURATION > Advanced Settings > XML Extensions*
- Create a new *XML extension* called *RETENTION*
- Add your rules. In this example we will add 3 rules:
  * Retain *File* document types during 1 year. Initially locked and deleted at the end of the period. Reminder sent 3 days before the end of the period.
  * Retain *Picture* document types during 1 year. Initially locked and deleted at the end of the period. Reminder sent 3 days before the end of the period.
  * Retain *Video* document types during 1 year. Initially locked and deleted at the end of the period. Reminder sent 3 days before the end of the period.  

```xml
<extension target="org.nuxeo.ecm.retention.RetentionService" point="rules">
  
  <rule>
    <id>fileRetentionWithReminder</id>
    <begin-condition expression="document.getType()=='File'"></begin-condition>
    <begin-delay></begin-delay>
    <retention-duration>P1Y</retention-duration>
    <retention-reminder-days>3</retention-reminder-days>
    <begin-action>Document.Lock</begin-action>
    <end-action>Document.Delete</end-action>
    <end-condition expression=""></end-condition>
  </rule>
  
    <rule>
    <id>pictureRetentionWithReminder</id>
    <begin-condition expression="document.getType()=='Picture'"></begin-condition>
    <begin-delay></begin-delay>
    <retention-duration>P1Y</retention-duration>
    <retention-reminder-days>3</retention-reminder-days>
    <begin-action>Document.Lock</begin-action>
    <end-action>Document.Delete</end-action>
    <end-condition expression=""></end-condition>
  </rule>
  
    <rule>
    <id>videoRetentionWithReminder</id>
    <begin-condition expression="document.getType()=='Video'"></begin-condition>
    <begin-delay></begin-delay>
    <retention-duration>P1Y</retention-duration>
    <retention-reminder-days>3</retention-reminder-days>
    <begin-action>Document.Lock</begin-action>
    <end-action>Document.Delete</end-action>
    <end-condition expression=""></end-condition>
  </rule>
  
</extension>
```

### Attach a Rule

The following APIs are exposed in the RetentionService:
- a method to attach a rule on a single document:     
void attachRule(String ruleId, DocumentModel doc);
- a method to attach a rule to a query result
void attachRule(String ruleId, String query, CoreSession session);



### Checking rules to start or end the retention

- A post commmit listener inspects all the documents with the 'Record' facet for retention rules triggered by events
- A listener notified on 'checkRetentionEvent' queries  for: 
          1) unmanaged Records with the record:min_cutoff_at < currentDate ( the retention       should start)
          2) active Record with record:max_retention_at <= currentDate ( the retention should end).
       A scheduler is configured to trigger a 'checkRetentionEvent' daily. 

### Enforcing that a document under active retention can not be modified.

This is implemented with a new Security policy that denies access to a document under retention active.


## Build

    mvn clean install


## Simple test:
Create a dynamic retention rule that puts the document in retention when the document is modified and attach it to a document

1. Create the dynamic retention rule for 100 days triggered on 'documentModified'.
This rule is persisted as a facet on the input document.
```js
POST /Retention.CreateRule
with:
{
"docId": "65a47c93-5ac7-4ad1-ada8-f0c8201e3ae5", 
"params":{
	"retentionPeriod": "100D",
	"beginCondEvent" :"documentModified"
     }
}
=> this sends back the id of the rule.
```
2. Attach the rule on the input document.
```js
POST /Retention.AttachRule
{
"input": "01d0b119-ef17-49ed-8ffd-fef7ba48ce42", 
"params":{
	"ruleId": "65a47c93-5ac7-4ad1-ada8-f0c8201e3ae5"
     }
}
```
When the document is modified the first time it will pass under retention active.



## Deploy (how to install build product)

Direct to MP package if any. Otherwise provide steps to deploy on Nuxeo Platform: << Copy the built artifacts into `$NUXEO_HOME/templates/custom/bundles/` and activate the `custom` template. >>.
